# Face Recognition Based Attendance System Requirements
# Optimized for uv package manager (Windows Compatible - No C++ Build Tools Needed)

# Core dependencies
numpy==1.26.4                # Numerical computing library for array operations and matrix calculations
pandas==2.1.4                # Data manipulation and analysis library for structured data handling
pillow==10.0.1               # Python Imaging Library for image processing tasks
opencv-python==4.8.1.78      # Computer vision library with face detection capabilities (includes Haar Cascades)
opencv-contrib-python==4.8.1.78  # Extended OpenCV modules including face recognition algorithms (includes LBPH Recognizer)

# UI dependencies
tk==0.1.0                    # Tkinter wrapper for Python GUI development

# Utility libraries
python-dateutil==2.8.2       # Extensions to the standard datetime module
pytz==2023.3                 # Timezone library for date/time operations

# Note: This version removes dlib and face-recognition, which require Visual C++ build tools on Windows.
# The provided SingleModel.py script uses OpenCV's built-in Haar Cascade for detection
# and LBPH for recognition, which do not require these libraries.
